# Fun with WebGL 2.0 - 096 - Infinite Terrain
**Description**:
Today we're going to build a manager that handles and recycles items in a 9 cell grid. This allows us to create chunks of terrains and as we move around we can shift chunks into new positions and recycle old ones to display new pieces of terrain. You can move in any direction and new terrain will be generated.
